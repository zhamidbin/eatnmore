# eatnmore

The web application I have developed as my project will serve as a social networking site 

where people will get to discover great places to eat nearby and follow people to get updated 

which new places they visited and what they experienced. 

Proposed System : 

At first, an user will register to the site by entering their full name, user name, email and 

password. The given password will be encrypted before it gets stored in the database. After 

registration user will be directed to the login page and on submitting proper combination of 

user name and password, user will enter the site. User will be able to see his details on his 

profile page and edit these fields as well. Users can find people who are currently members of 

the site and follow/un follow them. Timeline would show posts shared by the people an user 

is following and user him/herself will be able to share his/her own status. User will also send 

and receive messages to and from the people they are following. The Restaurant directory 

will show the restaurants currently added to the site while user can search by area or cuisine 

to filter them accordingly. A restaurant profile shows its exact location at the centre of a map 

and reviews done by people who have been there. User will be able to enlist restaurants 

he/she has already been to.
